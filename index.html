                time I branched out and tried a pesto pizza and it was just as
                delicious! My favorite fishbowl is the Jamaican ten speed!</p>

                visiting the area! Those that live here can enjoy it all the
                time but if you don't try it you're really missing out! TOSTADA PIZZA!</p>

                <p class="review">Stopped for a late lunch. My husband got a sausage and pepperoni
                pizza and I got the  Greek pizza, both were delicious. Our kids
                each fit a spaghetti and meatballs and enjoyed it. Excellent
                drink menu and food was good. Great meal, check it out.</p>

                <p class="review">The lobster pizza was so good, garlic chicken pizza amazing, tostado
                pizza good too, but of the three lobster was our favorite. The crust
                was perfectly crispy.  Nice selection of beers too.</p>

            <h1>Our History</h1>
            <p>
                On January 1, 1965, the Ambassador Restaurant opened under new ownership. The new owners,
                the Rossi family, had transformed the space from a tap bar into a restaurant that specialized
                in pizza and sandwiches. In 1978, the Ambassador was expanded into the space next door,
                and the second dining room was added. In January 2007, the Ambassador became a non-smoking
                establishment. To explain the history of the Ambassador and the unique murals that line
                the interior walls, the owners conducted research and wrote a poem detailing the story.
                The poem, entitled "Come Fill a Bumper," has since been printed on the cover of the Ambassador menu.
